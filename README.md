When you open the page of this game, it will randomly select a word within its word bank that you must guess with only five mistakes. In order to make a guess, you hit one of the letter keys on your keyboard. If you are correct, it will fill in that letter at the correct spot in the word. If you are wrong, it will tell you so and lower the number of mistakes that you can make in this round of guessing the word.

## Instructions

The completed game should meet the following criteria:

1. The completed game should be able to receive user input using the `inquirer` or `prompt` npm packages.

2. Your solution should have, at minimum, three files:

* **Letter.js**: Contains a constructor, Letter. This constructor should be able to either display an underlying character or a blank placeholder (such as an underscore), depending on whether or not the user has guessed the letter. That means the constructor should define:

  * A string value to store the underlying character for the letter

  * A boolean value that stores whether that letter has been guessed yet

  * A function that returns the underlying character if the letter has been guessed, or a placeholder (like an underscore) if the letter has not been guessed

  * A function that takes a character as an argument and checks it against the underlying character, updating the stored boolean value to true if it was guessed correctly

* **Word.js**: Contains a constructor, Word that depends on the Letter constructor. This is used to create an object representing the current word the user is attempting to guess. That means the constructor should define:

  * An array of `new` Letter objects representing the letters of the underlying word

  * A function that returns a string representing the word. This should call the function on each letter object (the first function defined in `Letter.js`) that displays the character or an underscore and concatenate those together.

  * A function that takes a character as an argument and calls the guess function on each letter object (the second function defined in `Letter.js`)

* **index.js**: The file containing the logic for the course of the game, which depends on `Word.js` and:

  * Randomly selects a word and uses the `Word` constructor to store it

  * Prompts the user for each guess and keeps track of the user's remaining guesses

3. `Letter.js` *should not* `require` any other files.

4. `Word.js` *should only* require `Letter.js`

5. **HINT:** Write `Letter.js` first and test it on its own before moving on, then do the same thing with `Word.js`

6. **HINT:** If you name your letter's display function `toString`, JavaScript will call that function automatically whenever casting that object to a string (check out this example: <https://jsbin.com/facawetume/edit?js,console>)
